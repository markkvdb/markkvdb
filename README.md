### Bonjour / Hoi / Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data enthusiast who loves both the science and engineering side of data. Concrete things I like doing:

1. Organising and orchestrating the inflow of data to an easy-to-explore data warehouse.
2. Learning to write simple and beautiful software using best practices in different programming paradigms: OOP, functional, imperative.
3. Exploring and leveraging patterns in all sorts of data (images, text, tabular) using all sorts of models (statistical and ML).
4. Connecting explorative and predictive analysis with prescriptive analysis using Operations Research techniques.
